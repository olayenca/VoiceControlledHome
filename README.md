# VoiceControlledHome
This project uses an arduino mirocontroller and a V3 Voice Recognition module, trained to respond to user commands such as turning a light bulb on and off, low to high and responding to basic questions while outputing on a TFT display. 
A bluetooth module was also implemented to control the bulb from a mobile phone.
